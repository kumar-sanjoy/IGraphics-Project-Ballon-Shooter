Hello there, itâ€™s my IGraphics project, Ballon Shooter. Find the imain.cpp file and you can see the source code, if you wish to run the game on your device download all files including the zipped folder, and keep them in your project folder. The zipped folder contains necessary background music, photos etc.
Enjoy
